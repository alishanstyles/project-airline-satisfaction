# Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project! This project aims to analyze and predict customer satisfaction with airlines based on a dataset available on Kaggle. Students will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Plotly, build predictive models using KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, and showcase their results through a Streamlit app.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data). The dataset contains information about airline passengers, including features such as flight distance, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, and more.

## Task
In this project, your primary task is to read the airline satisfaction dataset into a Jupyter Notebook that you will create. Begin by performing essential data cleaning tasks to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Utilize Plotly for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating interactive visualizations to gain insights into the dataset. Subsequently, employ machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to build predictive models. Evaluate and compare the performance of these models to determine their effectiveness in predicting airline satisfaction-- don't forget to compare to a baseline model! Lastly, present your findings in a Streamlit app, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform to showcase the results of your analysis and model performance.

Happy coding, and good luck! ‚úàÔ∏èüìäü§ñ
